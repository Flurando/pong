* PROJECT DESCRIPTION

* INSTALL & SETUP
you need guile chickadee to run this little game

I recommend using guix to have an easy go

just install guix according to the formal website or get one from your package manager and run `guix pull`, followed by some setup according to the hints printed by guix in the terminal

After guix is there, execute ~guix install guile guile-chickadee~ or ~guix shell guile guile-chickadee~

to launch the game, use ~guile game.scm~ or ~./game.scm~ if you gave it right to be executed like a script

* HOW TO PLAY
Use left and right arrow key to move the board at the bottom

Use a and d key to move the board at the top

* HACKING
I would continually change the script and you are welcomed to modify it any how you like, as long as you do it the foss way.

My recommended set up is of course =emacs= + =geiser=!
